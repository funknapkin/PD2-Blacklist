About this mod
==============

**This is a public beta**

This mod adds a blacklist in Payday 2. It tracks users using their steam id, so
once someone has been added there is no way he can avoid it.

A chat message will be shown every time someone in your blacklist connects to
you, either when you join their game or they join yours.


Installation
============
 1. Install [BLT](http://paydaymods.com/download/)
 2. Download this mod (from the bar on the right) and copy the *Blacklist*
    folder into your *mods* folder (typically *C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\PAYDAY 2\mods*)


Usage
=====
Every option is accessible from the *Mod Options* menu. Note that you don't have
to add a user to the blacklist before disconnecting from them, the mod will
remember the last 10 users you connected to.


Known issues
============
 * The text input UI is a bit wonky, but it works;
 * The text input UI is drawn under the Payday menu.
