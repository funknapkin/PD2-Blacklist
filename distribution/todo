Code cleanup:
- Make a class to encapsulate the user data (name, user_id, reason for ban, etc)
  Use this class where appropriate
- Script to make release .zip
- Find a better way to make global variables, for backlog and last users list
- Unit tests
- Make ticket on github, telling me to fix possible performance issue when
  adding new user to blacklist (json save/load)
- BLT feature request: have an option for MenuHelper:AddMultipleChoice to use
  non-localized data
